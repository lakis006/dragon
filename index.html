    A dragon is a large, serpentine legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures around the world. 
    Beliefs about dragons vary drastically by region, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often 
    been depicted as winged, horned, four-legged, and capable of breathing fire.
